# **AI-Powered Chatbot with Text Extraction Capabilities**

This project combines various technologies to create an AI-powered chatbot that can extract text from images, PDFs, and Word documents. It uses **Tesseract OCR** for image text extraction, **PyMuPDF** for PDFs, **python-docx** for Word documents, and **OpenAI** to generate AI-driven responses. The chatbot is built using **Gradio** for its user interface and integrated with **Groq** for optimized performance.

## **Features**
- **Multi-file Support**: Upload images, PDFs, and Word documents for text extraction.
- **AI-powered Conversational Interface**: Get responses using natural language processing via OpenAI.
- **Performance Optimization**: Integrates with Groq for fast and efficient processing.

## **Requirements**
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## **Installation**

1. **Tesseract OCR Installation**  
   Download and install Tesseract OCR for image text extraction:
   - Visit the official [Tesseract GitHub repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
   - Download the latest installer (e.g., `tesseract-ocr-w32-setup-v5.4.0.20220606.exe`).

2. **Required Python Libraries**  
   Use `pip` to install the necessary libraries:
   - PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction.
   - python-docx for extracting text from Word files.
   - pytesseract to interface with Tesseract.
   - Gradio for building the chatbot interface.
   - OpenAI for AI-powered responses.
   - Groq for optimizing model inference.
   - Swarmauri and python-dotenv for environment configuration and performance.

3. **Upgrading pip**  
   Ensure that you have the latest version of pip installed and check for any dependency issues.

4. **Virtual Environment Setup**  
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies:
   - Create and activate a virtual environment suitable for your operating system.

## **Usage**
Once everything is installed and set up:

1. Run the chatbot script to start the Gradio interface.
2. The chatbot will allow users to upload images, PDFs, or Word documents, extract text from them, and receive responses generated using OpenAI.
